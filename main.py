# 1. Create a file called hello.py that contains a single function hello(). 
# This function should accept a single string parameter name 
# print the text Hello {name}! to the interactive window with {name}
#  replaced with the function argument. 
# Add a file called main.py that imports the hello() function from hello.py 
# and calls the function with your name.



from hello import hello_funct

if __name__ == '__main__':
 hello_funct('Test')


#  2. Install the custom library          
# 1. Create a virtual environment          
# 2. Install numpy package in the virtual environment (version 1.22.4 or higher, but lower than 2.0.0)          
# 3. Generate a requirements.txt file         
# 4. Write a script that imports numpy. 
# Execute code from their site (https://numpy.org/) and run it on a local computer          
# 5. As a result, you should send a screenshot of the executed code on your machine, requirements.txt and a .py file
